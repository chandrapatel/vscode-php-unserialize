# PHP Unserialize VSCode Extension

This extension provides `PHP Unserialize` command to unserialize serialized data.

As developer I used to use online tool or run PHP code to unserialize data. So I thought that developing VSCode extension would be helpful.

**Note:** This extension is not released on VSCode Marketplace.

## Installation

- Clone this repo to `$HOME/.vscode/extensions/` folder.
- Open or reload VSCode and this extension will be available to use.
- Refer [Installing Extensions](https://vscode-docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/extensions/install-extension/) article.

## Usage

- Add serialized data in editor and select it.
- Open [Command Palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) and type `PHP Unserialize` and execute command.
